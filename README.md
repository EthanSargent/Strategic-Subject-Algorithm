# Strategic-Subject-Algorithm
A regression analysis of the Chicago Police Department's strategic subject algorithm. For an in-depth report, see the file report.pdf in the report folder. For a slide deck, see the presentation folder. Exploratory data analysis was done in EDA.ipynb, and all my modeling was done in regression.ipynb.
